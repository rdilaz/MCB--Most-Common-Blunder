Advanced Blunder Categorization: A Research and Implementation Plan for the MCB Application




Part 1: Foundational Concepts for Advanced Game Analysis


The existing analyze_games.py script represents a solid foundation, capable of identifying moves that cause a significant drop in evaluation. However, to achieve the goal of providing nuanced, human-understandable feedback similar to that of major chess platforms, a more sophisticated analytical framework is required. This section details the necessary paradigm shifts in evaluation philosophy and architectural design that will serve as the bedrock for the blunder categorization engine. We will transition from a simple centipawn-drop model to a state-of-the-art system that understands not just that a blunder occurred, but precisely why.


1.1 From Centipawn Loss to Win Probability: A Paradigm Shift in Evaluation


The current methodology for identifying blunders relies on a fixed centipawn loss threshold (e.g., 300 centipawns). While intuitive, this approach is fundamentally flawed because the significance of a centipawn drop is highly context-dependent. For example, a 200-centipawn drop when the position is already evaluated at +8 (overwhelmingly winning) is a minor inaccuracy, whereas a 200-centipawn drop from +0.5 to -1.5 is a game-losing blunder, transforming a slight advantage into a decisive disadvantage.2
Major chess analysis platforms like Chess.com and Lichess have addressed this by moving away from linear centipawn loss to a more sophisticated "Expected Points" or "Win Probability" model.4 This model acknowledges the non-linear, sigmoidal relationship between the centipawn evaluation and the actual probability of winning a game. The impact of a move is measured not by the raw change in evaluation, but by the change in the likelihood of winning.
To emulate this modern approach, the MCB application must adopt a similar model. Lichess provides a well-documented formula for converting a centipawn score into a win probability percentage, which serves as an excellent basis for our system 4:
Win
This formula maps the engine's centipawn output to a value between 0% and 100%, representing the player's chances of winning from that position. A blunder can then be defined as a move that causes a substantial drop in this probability. Chess.com, for instance, classifies a move as a blunder if it reduces the "Expected Points" (a value from 0.0 to 1.0, equivalent to win probability) by 0.20 or more.5
Implementation:
The first critical upgrade to analyze_games.py is to replace the centipawn drop trigger with one based on win probability. The following Python function implements the conversion formula:


Python




import math

def get_win_probability(centipawns: int) -> float:
   """
   Converts a centipawn evaluation to a win probability (0.0 to 1.0).
   The formula is derived from Lichess's open-source analysis.
   Ref: https://chess.stackexchange.com/a/41400
   """
   # The constant is derived from empirical data analysis by Lichess.
   # It controls the steepness of the sigmoid curve.
   c = 0.00368208
   
   # Sigmoid function to map centipawns to a win/draw/loss probability space.
   # The formula is equivalent to 1 / (1 + exp(-c * centipawns)) but scaled for a 0-1 range
   # representing win probability for the side being evaluated.
   return 50 + 50 * (2 / (1 + math.exp(-c * centipawns)) - 1)

The main analysis loop will now flag a move for deeper categorization only if the change in win probability exceeds a defined threshold, for example, 20% (0.20).
win_prob_before = get_win_probability(score_before)
win_prob_after = get_win_probability(score_after)
if (win_prob_before - win_prob_after) > 20.0:
# This move is a blunder, proceed with categorization.
This change aligns the core detection mechanism with industry best practices and is the essential first step toward building a meaningful categorization system.


1.2 The Multi-Pass Analysis Framework: Understanding the "Why"


To categorize a blunder—to explain why it was bad—it is insufficient to analyze only the move the player made. A blunder is often an error of omission as much as an error of commission. To label a move as "Missed a fork," the system must know that a fork was the best available move. To label it "Allows checkmate," it must know the opponent's best response.
This requires a fundamental architectural shift from a single-pass to a multi-pass analysis for each flagged move. The current script performs one evaluation comparison: before the move vs. after the move. The new system must perform several queries to build a complete picture of the tactical situation:
1. Player's Move Analysis: The initial analysis that identifies the win probability drop.
2. Best Alternative Analysis: An analysis of the position before the blunder to determine the engine's recommended best move (M_best). This tells us what opportunity was missed.
3. Opponent's Response Analysis: An analysis of the position after the blunder to determine the opponent's best response. This tells us how the blunder can be punished.
For example, consider the move 21. Kf1 in the third game provided.1 A single-pass analysis would only show a catastrophic evaluation drop. A multi-pass analysis reveals the full story:
* Pass 1 (Player's Move): 21. Kf1 causes the evaluation to plummet. Flag for analysis.
* Pass 2 (Best Alternative): The engine's best move for White might have been something else, perhaps 21. f4. The analysis of this move would show White is still in the game.
* Pass 3 (Opponent's Response): After 21. Kf1, the engine's best move for Black is 21... Rh1#.
By comparing the results of these passes, the system can conclude that the blunder's category is "Allows an Unavoidable Checkmate." This multi-pass approach is the conceptual core of the entire categorization engine.
Implementation:
The analysis function must be updated to leverage the multipv (multiple principal variations) option in the Stockfish engine protocol.6 For each position, instead of asking for just the single best move, we will request the top 2 or 3. This allows the system to compare the player's move against the engine's top choice (
info['pv']) to understand what was missed, all within a single, efficient engine query.


1.3 Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE): The Cornerstone of Material Analysis


A frequent and critical blunder category involves the loss of material. A simple check for whether a piece was captured on the next move is inadequate. A move can be a blunder because it permits a forced sequence of exchanges that culminates in a net material deficit. The standard algorithm for calculating the outcome of such a sequence is Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE).7
SEE analyzes a series of captures on a single target square, ignoring all other positional factors and threats on the board.8 It answers the question: "If I capture on this square, and my opponent recaptures, and I recapture, and so on, who comes out ahead in material?"
This tool is indispensable for accurately categorizing material-related blunders. However, the python-chess library, despite its power, does not include a built-in SEE function.9 Therefore, to implement robust material-loss categories, it is necessary to build a custom SEE implementation. This is a significant but essential undertaking for the project's success.
The logic for an SEE function relies on recursively (or iteratively) finding the least valuable attacker for a given square for each side. The python-chess library provides the necessary building blocks for this: board.attackers(color, square) returns a set of all pieces attacking a square, and board.piece_type_at(square) allows us to determine their value.11
Implementation:
The following is a complete, commented Python implementation of an iterative SEE function. This function is a prerequisite for the tactical analysis in Part 2 and should be added as a core utility in the project.


Python

# Standard piece values in centipawns
PIECE_VALUES = {
   chess.PAWN: 100,

       gain.pop()

   return gain



Part 2: A Taxonomy of Programmatic Blunder Categories


With the foundational analysis framework in place, we can now define a detailed hierarchy of blunder categories. This taxonomy is designed to be checked sequentially, from most to least severe, ensuring that a move is assigned the most critical and relevant error type. For example, a move that hangs a queen but also allows a mate-in-one should be categorized as the latter, as it is the more decisive error.
The following table provides a high-level summary of the proposed categorization system, outlining the detection logic and key tools for each category.

2.1 Catastrophic Blunders: Mates and Game-Losing Errors


These are the most severe errors, directly determining the outcome of the game. They must be checked first in the analysis pipeline.


2.1.1 Category: Allows an Unavoidable Checkmate


This is the most critical blunder a player can make. The detection logic is straightforward and leverages the multi-pass framework.
Detection Logic:
1. A move, M_user, is identified as a blunder due to a significant drop in win probability.
2. A temporary board state is created reflecting the position after M_user has been played: board_after_user_move = board.copy(); board_after_user_move.push(M_user).
3. This new position is analyzed with Stockfish.
4. The analysis result, info, is inspected. If info['score'].is_mate() returns True and the mate is in the opponent's favor (i.e., the score is negative for the player who just moved), this category is triggered.6 The PGN file contains a clear example: after White's
21. Kf1, Black can play 21... Rh1#, which this logic would identify immediately.1


2.1.2 Category: Missed Checkmate


This category represents a missed opportunity of the highest order. The player had a forced win but failed to see it. This is distinct from allowing a mate and requires analyzing the path not taken.
Detection Logic:
   1. A move, M_user, is identified as a blunder.
   2. The board state before M_user was played is analyzed with Stockfish, requesting multiple principal variations (multipv=2).
   3. The analysis result for the engine's top recommended move, M_best, is inspected.
   4. If the score for M_best indicates a forced mate (info['score'].is_mate() is True) and the mate is in the player's favor, this category is triggered. This correctly identifies a missed win, a concept discussed in various forums as a key type of blunder.13 Projects like
Chess-Tactic-Finder are built around similar logic for finding missed tactical shots.15


2.2 Tactical Blunders: Overlooking Threats and Opportunities


These blunders involve short-term oversights related to material calculation or common tactical patterns. They are the most common type of mistake for many players and form the core of the categorization system.


2.2.1 Category: Material Loss (Hangs a Piece or Losing Exchange)


This category covers moves that result in a direct, calculable loss of material. The SEE function is the primary tool for detection.
Detection Logic:
      1. A move, M_user, is identified as a blunder.
      2. Case 1: Losing Exchange. If M_user is a capture (board.is_capture(M_user)), the see(board, M_user) function is called. If the returned value is significantly negative (e.g., less than -100, indicating a loss of at least one pawn's worth of material), the move is categorized as a "Losing Exchange."
      3. Case 2: Hanging Piece. If M_user is not a capture, the system analyzes the opponent's best response, M_opponent_best. If M_opponent_best is a capture, see(board_after_user_move, M_opponent_best) is called. If this returns a significantly positive value (from the opponent's perspective), it means the player's move left a piece "hanging" or undefended. The blunder is categorized as "Hangs a Piece."
This dual logic, powered by SEE, provides a robust way to distinguish between poor trades and simple one-move piece drops, a key feature of advanced analysis.7


2.2.2 Category: Missed Material Gain


This is the inverse of the previous category, focusing on missed opportunities to win material.
Detection Logic:
      1. A move, M_user, is identified as a blunder.
      2. The engine's best alternative move, M_best, is retrieved.
      3. If M_best is a capture, the see(board, M_best) function is called.
      4. If the SEE value is significantly positive (e.g., greater than 100), it indicates that the player missed a favorable capture or exchange. This category is triggered. This approach reliably finds missed chances to win material, a common complaint in user-generated tactic finders.16


2.2.3 Category: Missed Tactical Motif (Fork, Pin, Skewer)


This category identifies situations where the player missed a specific, nameable tactical pattern. This requires dedicated heuristic functions for each motif. The logic for these functions is heavily inspired by open-source projects and the extensive resources of the Chess Programming Wiki.17
Detection Logic (Example for Fork):
      1. After identifying a blunder and determining the engine's best move, M_best, the system calls a dedicated detect_fork function.
      2. This function operates on the board state after M_best is played.
      3. It gets the set of squares attacked by the piece that just moved: attacked_squares = board_after_best_move.attacks(M_best.to_square).
      4. It then iterates through these attacked_squares, using board.piece_map() to check for the presence of valuable enemy pieces (e.g., Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, or an undefended King).11
      5. If two or more valuable enemy pieces are on the attacked_squares, a fork is detected. An additional check using SEE can confirm that the forking piece itself is not immediately lost in a disadvantageous trade.
The code example provided on StackExchange offers a direct template for this logic, demonstrating how to use board.attackers and board.attacks to find forked pieces.19
Implementation Detail:
Separate, well-documented Python functions for detect_fork, detect_pin, and detect_skewer must be created.
      * detect_fork(board, move): Implements the logic described above.
      * detect_pin(board, move): This function must be carefully implemented. The python-chess method board.is_pinned(color, square) is a low-level check that identifies if a piece is on a line between its king and an enemy slider, but it does not validate if the piece can legally move along that line.20 The detection logic must therefore first identify a pin using
is_pinned and then check if the engine's best move involves exploiting this pin by attacking the pinned piece with a lower-valued attacker.
      * detect_skewer(board, move): A skewer is the inverse of a pin. A piece attacks a valuable enemy piece, which, if it moves, exposes a less valuable piece behind it. The logic would involve checking the ray of attack from move.to_square through the target piece to see if another enemy piece lies on the same line.


2.3 Positional Blunders: Long-Term Strategic Errors


These are the most subtle errors, where the evaluation drop stems from a degradation of long-term strategic factors rather than an immediate tactical oversight. Their detection relies on heuristics that quantify abstract positional concepts.


2.3.1 Category: Weakens King Safety


This blunder involves making a move that compromises the king's shelter, inviting future attacks.
Detection Logic:
         1. This check is performed with lower priority, after tactical blunders have been ruled out.
         2. A heuristic function, calculate_king_safety(board, color), is defined. A simple and effective heuristic is a "king tropism" score, which measures the threat level based on the proximity of enemy pieces to the king.21
         3. The function iterates through all enemy pieces, calculates their distance to the friendly king using chess.square_distance(piece_square, king_square) 22, and adds their material value to a score, weighted inversely by the distance. A closer, more valuable piece contributes more to the threat score.
         4. The king safety score is calculated before and after the player's move. If the score shows a significant degradation (i.e., the threat score increases substantially), this category is triggered.


2.3.2 Category: Creates a Critical Pawn Weakness


This category identifies moves that create long-term, exploitable weaknesses in the pawn structure.
Detection Logic:
         1. A function evaluate_pawn_structure(board, color) is defined to score the pawn structure by assigning penalties for common weaknesses like isolated, doubled, or backward pawns.23
         2. To detect an isolated pawn: For each friendly pawn, the function checks the adjacent files for other friendly pawns. If none are found, a penalty is applied. The implementation provided on StackExchange offers a clear method for this by iterating through board columns.25
         3. To detect doubled pawns: The function iterates through each file and counts the number of friendly pawns. If the count is greater than one, a penalty is applied for each extra pawn.
         4. The total pawn structure score is calculated before and after the player's move. A significant negative change in this score indicates a blunder of this type.


2.3.3 Category: Forfeits a Major Positional Advantage (Catch-all)


This is the default category for blunders that are not easily explained by simple tactical or structural heuristics. It represents a deep positional misjudgment that the engine understands but which defies simple classification.
Detection Logic:
This category is the final step in the if/elif/else pipeline. If a move has been flagged as a blunder due to a large drop in win probability but has not triggered any of the specific catastrophic, tactical, or positional checks defined above, it is assigned this label. This serves as a necessary catch-all, acknowledging the complexity of chess and the superior positional understanding of modern engines.23


Part 3: Implementation and Integration Plan


This section provides a concrete roadmap for integrating the advanced categorization engine into the existing Most Common Blunder (MCB) application, focusing on refactoring the Python backend and structuring the data for the Flask API.


3.1 Refactoring analyze_games.py for Advanced Categorization


The current analyze_games.py script is structured for a simple task and must be refactored to accommodate the new, more complex analysis pipeline.
Implementation Steps:
         1. Rename and Restructure Core Function: The primary function, find_blunders(), should be renamed to analyze_and_categorize_blunders() to reflect its new capabilities.
         2. Change Return Type: The function should no longer return a simple list of moves with centipawn drops. The new return type will be a list of rich dictionary objects, providing comprehensive information about each blunder. For example:
JSON
{
 "fen_before": "r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/5B2/2P1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 11",
 "move_san": "Rb1",
 "win_prob_loss": 25.4,
 "category": "Missed Tactic",
 "description": "You missed an opportunity to win material with the tactic Bxf7+.",
 "best_move_san": "Bxf7+",
 "game_link": "https://www.chess.com/game/live/139563605820"
}

         3. Adopt Win Probability Trigger: The core logic for flagging a move should be updated to use the get_win_probability() function developed in Part 1.1. A move is flagged for categorization if the drop in win probability exceeds a configurable threshold (e.g., 20%).
         4. Efficient Engine Management: The Stockfish engine process should be initialized once at the beginning of the analysis and reused for all subsequent engine queries. This avoids the significant overhead of starting and stopping the engine process for every move, which is crucial for performance. The python-chess library's engine management handles this gracefully.


3.2 The Blunder Categorization Pipeline (The categorize_blunder function)


This new master function will orchestrate the analysis for a single blundered move. Its structure is critical for both accuracy and performance. A strict, hierarchical checking order is paramount to prevent mislabeling. For instance, a move that allows mate-in-1 must be labeled as such, even if it also happens to hang a piece. The check for the more severe error must come first.
This leads to a clear implementation pattern using a sequence of if/elif checks, ordered by the severity and certainty of the blunder category. The function should return a category and a descriptive string as soon as a match is found.
Implementation (Pseudocode):


Python




def categorize_blunder(board_before: chess.Board, user_move: chess.Move, win_prob_loss: float) -> dict:
   """
   Orchestrates the analysis of a single blunder to assign it a category.
   This function follows a strict hierarchical order of checks.
   """
   # Pass 1: Catastrophic Blunders (most severe, check first)
   if (category_info := check_for_allowed_mate(board_before, user_move)):
       return category_info
   if (category_info := check_for_missed_mate(board_before, user_move)):
       return category_info

   # Pass 2: Tactical Blunders (concrete material and tactical oversights)
   if (category_info := check_for_material_loss(board_before, user_move)):
       return category_info
   if (category_info := check_for_missed_tactic(board_before, user_move)):
       # This function would internally check for forks, pins, skewers, etc.
       return category_info

   # Pass 3: Positional Blunders (more subtle, heuristic-based checks)
   if (category_info := check_for_king_safety_degradation(board_before, user_move)):
       return category_info
   if (category_info := check_for_pawn_weakness(board_before, user_move)):
       return category_info

   # Pass 4: Fallback for unclassified major errors
   return {
       "category": "Positional Misunderstanding",
       "description": "This move leads to a significant positional disadvantage for complex reasons."
   }

Each check_for_* function would encapsulate the specific detection logic detailed in Part 2 and return a dictionary with the category and description, or None if the condition is not met.


3.3 Aggregating and Presenting Results for the "Most Common Blunder"


The ultimate goal of the MCB application is to distill the analysis of multiple games into a single, actionable insight for the user: their most common type of mistake.
Implementation Logic:
            1. The analyze_and_categorize_blunders() function will be called for each game in the input PGN file. The results will be collected into a single, flat list of blunder dictionaries.
            2. Python's collections.Counter is the ideal tool for this task. It can be used to efficiently count the occurrences of each value associated with the "category" key in the list of blunder dictionaries.
Python
from collections import Counter

all_blunders = [...] # List of blunder dicts from all games
blunder_categories = [b['category'] for b in all_blunders]
category_counts = Counter(blunder_categories)

if category_counts:
   most_common = category_counts.most_common(1)
   most_common_blunder_type = most_common
   most_common_blunder_count = most_common

            3. The final result to be passed to the API should be a summary object that is easy for the frontend to consume. This object should include the most common blunder, its frequency, and an example from the analyzed games.
JSON
{
 "summary": {
   "most_common_blunder": "Missed Material Gain",
   "count": 7,
   "total_blunders": 25,
   "percentage": 28.0,
   "example_game_link": "https://www.chess.com/game/live/139567778280",
   "example_fen": "r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/5B2/2P1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 11"
 },
 "all_blunders": [
   // Full list of blunder dictionaries
 ]
}



3.4 API and Frontend Integration


The new analysis logic must be exposed via the Flask API to be accessible by the web frontend. The project summary indicates this is the next immediate step.
Recommendations:
               1. The existing Flask route, such as /api/analyze/<username>, should be enhanced. When called, it will execute the get_games.py logic to fetch the PGN data and then pass this data to the new analyze_and_categorize_blunders() function.
               2. The function will return the aggregated summary object described in section 3.3. This object will be converted to a JSON response using Flask's jsonify utility.
               3. The frontend JavaScript (main.js) will be updated to make a fetch request to this API endpoint. Upon receiving the JSON data, it can dynamically populate the "blunder cards" with the user's most common mistake, the statistical breakdown, and provide a link to an example game.
               4. By also returning the all_blunders list in the API response, the frontend can be further enhanced to display a detailed, move-by-move breakdown of every single error identified across all analyzed games, providing a much richer and more educational user experience.


Appendix: python-chess Tactical Analysis Toolkit


This table serves as a quick-reference guide to the most relevant python-chess functions and methods for implementing the blunder categorization logic. Understanding these tools is essential for translating the algorithms in this plan into working code.
Function/Method
	What it Does
	Use Case in Blunder Analysis
	Notes/Gotchas
	board.is_checkmate()
	Checks if the current position is a checkmate.
	Core function for detecting both "Allows Checkmate" and "Missed Checkmate" categories.
	Simple and reliable. Already used in the existing analyze_games.py to handle edge cases.
	board.is_capture(move)
	Returns True if the given move is a capture.
	Used to trigger SEE analysis and to differentiate between "Losing Exchange" and "Hangs a Piece".
	A fundamental check for any material-related analysis.
	board.attackers(color, square)
	Gets a set of squares occupied by pieces of the given color that attack the square.
	Crucial for the custom SEE implementation and for tactical pattern detectors (e.g., finding attackers of a forked piece).
	Pinned pieces are considered attackers by this function.12
	board.is_attacked_by(color, square)
	A boolean check to see if a square is attacked by a given color.
	A faster alternative to len(board.attackers(...)) > 0 for simple threat detection.
	Also considers pinned pieces as attackers.12
	board.attacks(square)
	Gets a set of squares attacked by the piece on the given square.
	The primary tool for the detect_fork function to find all pieces threatened by the forking move.
	Returns an empty set if the square is empty. Pinned pieces are still considered to be attacking.27
	board.is_pinned(color, square)
	Checks if the piece on square of the given color is absolutely pinned to its king.
	The starting point for the detect_pin function.
	This is a low-level check. It returns True even for pieces (like pawns) that cannot legally move along the pin axis. Requires additional logic to be useful for tactical detection.20
	board.king(color)
	Returns the square of the king of the given color.
	Essential for king safety calculations (finding the king's location) and for pin/skewer detection logic.
	Returns None if the king is not on the board, which should not happen in a standard game.
	board.piece_map()
	Returns a dictionary of square: piece for all pieces on the board.
	Highly efficient for iterating through pieces to calculate material, pawn structure, and king safety heuristics.
	Faster than iterating through all 64 squares with board.piece_at().
	chess.square_distance(a, b)
	Gets the Chebyshev distance (max of file/rank difference) between two squares.
	The core of the "king tropism" heuristic for quantifying king safety by measuring piece proximity.
	A direct and efficient way to measure distance for threat assessment.22
	engine.analyse(..., multipv=N)
	Instructs the engine to return the top N moves instead of just one.
	The key to the multi-pass analysis framework. Allows comparison of the user's move to the engine's best alternative in one query.6
	Setting multipv to 2 or 3 is usually sufficient and balances detail with performance.
	score.is_mate()
	A method on the PovScore object returned by the engine, indicating a forced mate.
	Used to check for mate scores in the "Allows Checkmate" and "Missed Checkmate" categories.
	The score object also contains score.mate() which gives the number of moves to mate.6
