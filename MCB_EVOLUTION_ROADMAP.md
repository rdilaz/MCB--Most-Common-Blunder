# MCB Evolution Roadmap: From Single Game to Pattern Recognition

## 🎯 **CORE PURPOSE TRANSFORMATION**

### **Current State**: Single Game Analysis

- Analyzes 1 game at a time
- Reports all blunders found
- No pattern recognition or frequency analysis

### **Target State**: Most Common Blunder Identifier

- Analyzes 40-50 recent games
- Identifies recurring mistake patterns
- Ranks blunders by frequency × impact
- Provides targeted improvement recommendations

---

## 📊 **WIN PROBABILITY WEIGHTING SYSTEM**

### **New Blunder Scoring Formula**

```python
blunder_score = win_prob_drop * frequency_multiplier * severity_weight

Where:
- win_prob_drop: 0-100% (from Chess engine evaluation)
- frequency_multiplier: 1.0 + (occurrences / total_games)
- severity_weight: Based on blunder category (checkmate = 3.0, material = 2.0, positional = 1.0)
```

### **Blunder Categories by Impact**

1. **Critical (3.0x weight)**: Allowed/Missed Checkmate
2. **Major (2.0x weight)**: Material Loss, Missed Material Gain, Allowed/Missed Forks
3. **Minor (1.0x weight)**: Positional mistakes, missed pins

### **Example Analysis Output**

```
🎯 YOUR MOST COMMON BLUNDER: "Hanging Pieces"
   📊 Frequency: 23/50 games (46%)
   📉 Average Impact: -18.3% win probability
   🏆 Severity Score: 42.1

   Recent Examples:
   ♟️  Game vs. Player123: Move 15 Qd4 (left Queen undefended, -24% win prob)
   ♟️  Game vs. Player456: Move 22 Be5 (left Bishop undefended, -19% win prob)
   ♟️  Game vs. Player789: Move 8 Nf6 (left Knight undefended, -15% win prob)
```

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PHASES**

### **Phase 1: Backend Multi-Game Analysis**

**File**: `analyze_games.py`

```python
# New function signatures needed:
def analyze_multiple_games(pgn_file, username, game_limit=50, filters=None)
def aggregate_blunder_patterns(all_blunders)
def calculate_blunder_scores(aggregated_patterns)
def generate_pattern_report(scored_blunders)
```

### **Phase 2: Game Filtering System**

**File**: `get_games.py`

```python
# Enhanced game fetching with filters
def fetch_filtered_games(username, filters):
    # filters = {
    #     'game_count': 50,
    #     'rated_only': True,
    #     'time_controls': ['blitz', 'rapid'],
    #     'min_rating': 800,
    #     'date_range': (start_date, end_date)
    # }
```

### **Phase 3: Frontend Settings Panel**

**File**: `index.html` + `main.js`

```html
<!-- New settings panel -->
<div class="settings-panel">
  <h3>Analysis Settings</h3>
  <label
    >Number of Games:
    <input type="range" min="1" max="50" value="20" id="gameCount">
  /></label>
  <label
    >Game Types:
    <select multiple id="gameTypes">
      <option value="bullet">Bullet</option>
      <option value="blitz">Blitz</option>
      <option value="rapid">Rapid</option>
      <option value="classical">Classical</option>
    </select>
  </label>
  <label
    >Rating Filter:
    <select id="ratingFilter">
      <option value="all">All Games</option>
      <option value="rated">Rated Only</option>
      <option value="unrated">Unrated Only</option>
    </select>
  </label>
</div>
```

### **Phase 4: Game Linking & Identification**

```html
<!-- Enhanced results display -->
<div class="blunder-result">
  <h4>🎯 Hanging Pieces (Score: 42.1)</h4>
  <p>Found in 23/50 games (46% frequency)</p>
  <div class="game-examples">
    <div class="game-link">
      <a href="https://chess.com/game/live/140229850092" target="_blank">
        🔗 vs. Zirre96 (3+0 Blitz, 2025-01-02)
      </a>
      <span class="blunder-details">Move 18: Qxd4+ (-24% win prob)</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
